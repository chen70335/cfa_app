# What API did you use and why?
I used the OpenWeather API because it was the most intuitive. Because I am still
new to React and have foundational knowledge in JavaScript/HTML/CSS, I wanted to start by doing something more simple.

# What are some other applications for your API other than searching? Name a few and describe how an app using it for that purpose might work.
Some other applications for OpenWeather API are national weather alerts, which a news app could use to alert its readers of national emergencies, historical weather data collection, which data scientists could use to analyze weather patterns and potentially the effects of global warming on changing weather, and more applications are definitely possible.

# Explain the considerations you needed to make for the website to be responsive & mobile-friendly.
I made sure that the site was responsive to the size of the web layout, and it was designed so the all of the content are in the middle which makes it mobile-firendly as well.

# How can you make your app accessible to people with disabilities such as blindness or colorblindness?
I can make my app accessible to people with disabilities such as blindness or colorblindness by including voice assitance to every element I have created on the website, and be able to read out the information that a user searches for. Interms of colorblindness, my app currently does not depend on color for understanding of the results.

# If you could make further changes to your project to improve/expand the experience, what would they be and how would you go about implementing them?
I would further extend the application of this API to the other features that OpenWeather offers which I mentioned previously. I would go about implementing them by first growing my knowledge of React through Youtube videos, Codeacademy, and more. Having a foundational knowledge of React is important before I take the next step forward.
